Doughy Delights is a premium cake shop in Chennai. 
We opened in 2016, when Chennai was grappling with a lack of choice for quality cakes. 
After months of meticulous baking, Doughy Delights headed every must visit list of cafes in Chennai. 
The Hindu called Doughy Delights as the "Hip new cafe on a roll".
 Doughy Delights currently serves happiness from two swanky cafes in prime locales of Chennai.</p>

During a visit to Coimbatore in 2016, we faced a lot of challenges to order a premium cake online. 
Problems like non-functional website, lack of response and long delivery wait times.
 That's when we decided to go online and solve this predicament to the best of our abilities.
